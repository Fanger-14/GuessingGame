**Game Title: Guess the Number**

**Description:**
"Guess the Number" is a web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player starts with a score of 20 and must guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 20. Each incorrect guess deducts 1 point from the score. If the player successfully guesses the number and their score exceeds the previous high score, the high score is updated.

**Technical Details:**
The game leverages various JavaScript techniques to enhance functionality and user interaction. **DOM Manipulation** allows for dynamic updates to the user interface based on player inputs, creating a responsive and interactive experience. **Event Listeners** capture user actions, such as button clicks, triggering the corresponding game logic to process the guesses. The game employs **Random Number Generation** using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 20, ensuring unpredictability in each round. **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) are used to compare the player's guess with the target number and update the score accordingly, providing immediate feedback to the player. **State Management** involves using variables to keep track of the current score and high score, ensuring the game state is consistently updated and accurate. Additionally, **CSS** is used for styling the game interface, enhancing the overall user experience by providing a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

Overall, "Guess the Number" combines core JavaScript functionalities with a simple yet engaging gameplay loop, offering an enjoyable experience for players while showcasing effective use of web development technologies.
